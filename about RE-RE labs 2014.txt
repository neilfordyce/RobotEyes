RESEARCH FRONTIERS AC42001: WHAT ROBOT EYES CAN DO

**** MATLAB LABS 2014 ****

There are 4 MATLAB supervised-lab slots of 2 hours each.
The last lab slot is dedicated to the assessed demos of the group assignment.

See also on VLE:
- lab sheets
- assignment instructions
- full module timetable.


**** PURPOSE
- To try your hands at a real 3-D computer vision problem
- To develop a MATLAB program computing disparity maps, the basic element of computational stereo
- To learn or consolidate your knowledge and practice of MATLAB


**** MATERIALS
For the theory, see the handout on stereo on the VLE and references therein.
For stereo pairs, start using those provided on the VLE.
If you acquire your own, please remember to convert your images *before* processing
so that they are:
- black and white (not colour)
- about 300x300 pixels (larger will take too long to process)


**** LABORATORIES PLAN

Week 1:
	Introduction to / consolidation of MATLAB.
	Focus on elements needed for our task: acquiring images, matrix operations, display. 
	Playing with webcams/phones: acquire and load images into your MATLAB programs.

Week 2:
	load images, compare images to find corresponding elements. 
	This is the basic operation to build a disparity map.

Week 3:
	computing, visualizing, analyzing, improving disparity maps.

Week 4:
	complete assignment; **only if already completed**, try 3-D reconstruction by triangulation

Week 5:
	assessed demos of your final programs on data provided by the lecturer.
